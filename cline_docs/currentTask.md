- [x] Created adapter functions in `utils/typeConversions.ts`
- [x] Updated imports across the codebase
- [x] Fixed type compatibility issues in components:
  - [x] `IndicatorConfig.tsx`
  - [x] `StrategyBuilder.tsx`
  - [x] `ParameterOptimization.tsx`
  - [x] `IndicatorChartIntegration.tsx`
- [x] Verified application runs correctly with consolidated types
- [x] Documented type consolidation in `typeConsolidationSummary.md`
- [x] Updated `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with issues encountered

### In Progress
- [ ] Create pull request for type consolidation work

### Next Steps
- [ ] Address ESLint configuration issues (separate task)
- [ ] Update skipped tests in `strategyStore.test.ts` (separate task)
- [ ] Consider further consolidation of chart-related types

## Issues Encountered
